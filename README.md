### Description
This is a simple instagram recommender system, that proposes posts based on your account. In scraps data from web instagram using this library (https://github.com/OlegYurchik/pyInstagram#basic-installation), then parses the data from posts (hashtags, captions, bio ..) and stores it in the relational database.
I'm using content-based + knowledge-based recommender approaches (More info you can find in the book "Recommender Systems: An Introduction by Dietmar Jannach and Markus Zanker").
